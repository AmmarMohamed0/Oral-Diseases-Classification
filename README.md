# Oral-Diseases-Classification
This project uses ResNet18 to classify oral diseases like Calculus, Caries, and Gingivitis. Images are preprocessed, split, and augmented. The model is trained with early stopping, evaluated on accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix, and visualized with precision-recall curves.
